TODO: put the tasks into issue tracker

  * Base languages for the generation targets as described by the runtime on the LWC site:
    * HTML baselanguage (concepts + textgen + (default?) editors) --> ALLOCATED to Remi
    * CSS baselanguage (concepts + textgen + (default?) editors) --> ALLOCATED to Klemens
    * JavaScript baselanguage (concepts + textgen + (default?) editors)
  * Reference implementation example in plaintext (have a running version of a manually implemented questionnaire in HTML + CSS + JavaScript, using the runtime from the LWC site) --> ALLOCATED to Eugen
  * Example models:
    * A big binary search tree questionnaire model (see LWC site) --> ALLOCATED to Lorraine
    * A modularized binary search tree questionnaire model (see LWC site) --> ALLOCATED to Lorraine (will be done after the big BST model has been created, which will be used as a base for modularization)
  * The QLS DSL needs to be double checked (is it enough for this year's purposes?) --> ALLOCATED to Jeroen
  * Model verification tools (SAT/SLT?)
    * Find a suitable verifier (SAT/SLT)
    * Model the baselanguage of the verifier (in case of a verifier that has its own input language) or make an example program (in case of a library)
    * Integrate the SAT/SLT verifier such that its feedback come back to a user who edits a model
